Game Off is our annual game jam, where participants spend the month of November creating games based on a secret theme. 

This year’s  theme is LEAPS AND BOUNDS.

You’re welcome to interpret the theme however you wish, but if you need some ideas to kickstart your creativity, maybe your game could:

    Make your character evolve to overcome challenges
    Add obstacles to test your hero’s ability to leap into action
    Deduct points for anything going out of bounds
    Duck, dip, dive, and dodge an enemy that’s changing or moving rapidly
    Take place in the year 2020, the next leap year
